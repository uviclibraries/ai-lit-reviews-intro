# ResearchRabbit - Make Connections from Groups of Articles
ResearchRabbit AI is a tool designed to help researchers and academics navigate and discover relevant literature efficiently. It uses AI algorithms to map out connections between research papers, enabling users to find related work, identify trends, and explore new research areas. It also creates article summaries, but donâ€™t depend on the summaries being 100% accurate!

ResearchRabbit Training Data sources: _Microsoft Academic Graph_.

1. Let's do a search in ResearchRabbit on the same topic this time by adding one or two articles on the topic of your choice.
  - Open [ResearchRabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/){:target="_blank"}, and if you want to use it you'll need to create an account.
  - Click the green **Add Papers** button, and then type the following into the search bar and click the search button (_note that as of June 2024 ResearchRabbit does not support natural language queries, so we will do a keyword search. ResearchRabbit does use artificial intelligence for other aspects of its service_):
    <br>```Informal credentialling academic makerspaces```<br>
  - Try using ResearchRabbit to explore a topic you're interested in and hopefully find additional useful articles. Be curious and have some fun!
2. Test ResearchRabbit on a topic you know a lot about:
  - In ResearchRabbit, try doing a keyword search for a topic you know a lot about so that you can evaluate the quality of the results.
  - Now try the same search in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){:target="_blank"} and compare the ResearhRabbit results with Google Scholar.
2. Reflection time:
>  - Do the suggested "Similar Work", "Earlier Work", and "Later Work" look relevant and useful?
>  - Compared to the Google Scholar results, how high is the quality of the articles ResearchRabbit found?
>  - Does the network map of articles look like it might be helpful for you in your research?
>  - How useful do the articles look as informal credentialing for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?
>  - Overall, does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?
