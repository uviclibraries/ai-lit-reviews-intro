## UVic Guidelines for Using Generative AI in Research
As a researcher, it is very important that you carefully review UVic's guidelines for using [*Generative AI in research*](https://www.uvic.ca/research-innovation/strategic-initiatives/gen-ai-in-research/index.php){:target="_blank"}, which are based on Canada's [Tri-agency Artificial Intelligence guidelines](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/use-generative-artificial-intelligence-development-and-review-research-proposals/guidance-use-artificial-intelligence-development-and-review-research-grant-proposals){:target="_blank"}.

## Pre-Workshop Videos & Activities
This workshop consists of a small amount of instruction so that most of the scheduled time can be devoted to interactive practice with various AI tools for Literature Reviews. This allows participants to learn to use key features of these  tools for research purposes. Some of the AI tools included in the active learning portion of the workshop are:
- [Semantic Scholar](){:target="_blank"} (literature reviews)
- [Elicit](https://elicit.com/){:target="_blank"} (literature reviews)
- [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/){:target="_blank"} (literature reviews)
- [Undermind.ai](https://www.undermind.ai/){:target="_blank"} (literature reviews & GenAI research assistant)

To be ready to jump right into the interactive activities during the workshop, **please watch these short videos beforehand**:
