If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

**Two gentle reminders before you start** 
1. Undermind.ai is a research assistant that uses both AI to help you find... and GenAI to summarize the contents of peer reviewed resources, but as always, don’t depend on the summaries being 100% accurate and look at the text of the source if you think you might want to quote or summarize it!
2. Undermind.ai Training Data sources: **RESEARCH & UPDATE**: _Web scraping_ (including Open Access data) & _Indexing agreements with 50 publishers_.

1. Let’s do a search in Elicit on the same topic this time using more natural language.
  - Open [Undermind.ai](https://www.undermind.ai/){:target="_blank"}, and if you want to use it you’ll need to create an account.
  - **Update everything below...**
  - Type the following into the search bar and click the search button:
<br>```How useful is informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?```<br>
  - Try searching for information about a topic that you are interested in to further explore the capabilities of Elicit. Be curious and have some fun!
2. In Elicit, try doing a natural language search for a topic you know a lot about so that you can evaluate the quality of the results.
  - For example:
<br> ```Is informal credentialing helpful for academic makerspaces users in finding jobs?```<br>
  - Now try the same search in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){:target="_blank"} and compare the Elicit results with Google Scholar.
3. Reflection time:
>  - How useful do the articles look for your search?
>  - Compared to the Google Scholar results how high is the quality of the articles Elicit found?
>  - Does the combined 4 article summary look reasonable?
>  - How can you verify the accuracy of the summary?
>  - Does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?
