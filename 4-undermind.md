**Two gentle reminders before you start:** 

- Undermind.ai is a research assistant that employs both AI and GenAI to help you. It uses AI tools to try to find peer-reviewed resources related to your search and then uses GenAI to summarize the contents of peer-reviewed resources. As always with GenAI summaries, you can't depend on the summaries being 100% accurate all the time!
-  Undermind.ai is a useful tool, but please remember that it doesn ot have access to the whole universe of journal articles and peer-reviewed resources. The primary source of its training data sources is the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/){:target="_blank"} database of articles.

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1. Let’s do a search in Elicit on the same topic this time using more natural language.
  - Open [Undermind.ai](https://www.undermind.ai/){:target="_blank"}, and if you want to use it you’ll need to create an account.
  - **Update everything below...**
  - Type the following into the search bar and click the search button:
<br>```How useful is informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?```<br>
  - Try searching for information about a topic that you are interested in to further explore the capabilities of Elicit. Be curious and have some fun!
2. In Elicit, try doing a natural language search for a topic you know a lot about so that you can evaluate the quality of the results.
  - For example:
<br> ```Is informal credentialing helpful for academic makerspaces users in finding jobs?```<br>
  - Now try the same search in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){:target="_blank"} and compare the Elicit results with Google Scholar.
3. Reflection time:
>  - How useful do the articles look for your search?
>  - Compared to the Google Scholar results how high is the quality of the articles Elicit found?
>  - Does the combined 4 article summary look reasonable?
>  - How can you verify the accuracy of the summary?
>  - Does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?
