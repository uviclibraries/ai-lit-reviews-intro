- Hands-on activities: 40 min

## About the Workshop 

Workshop participants will explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist with literature reviews and consider ethical considerations such as plagiarism, privacy, and research integrity. Participants will gain a basic understanding of a handful of AI-powered literature review tools as well as the ethical implications of their use in research. In the hands-on portion of the workshop, participants will explore AI literature review tools and evaluate outputs for accuracy and biases.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical implications of using AI tools for literature reviews, including issues related to plagiarism, data privacy, and research integrity.
2. Identify specific use cases for a range of AI tools for literature reviews.
4. Demonstrate how to use AI tools effectively for literature reviews and other research purposes
5. Evaluate Quality and Reliability: Critically evaluate the outputs of AI tools, including assessing accuracy, relevance, and potential biases.
6. Attribution: Cite outputs from GenAI tools using APA, MLA, IEEE, or other citation styles.
